# Booklopedia: Unveiling Encyclopedia Edition

- Enhanced Book Information: Overriding Member Functions with Encyclopedia Class.

This project is written in `C++`, focused on the `concept of overriding member functions`. It involves creating a derived class called `Encyclopedia`, which overrides the `PrintInfo() function` of the base Book class. The overridden function prints additional information, including the edition and number of volumes of the book.

## Input Example:

```
The Hobbit
J. R. R. Tolkien
George Allen & Unwin
21 September 1937
The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Universe
James W. Guthrie
Watson-Guptill
2001
2nd
1

```

## Output Example:

The program generates the following output based on the input:

```
Book Information:
   Book Title: The Hobbit
   Author: J. R. R. Tolkien
   Publisher: George Allen & Unwin
   Publication Date: 21 September 1937
Book Information:
   Book Title: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Universe
   Author: James W. Guthrie
   Publisher: Watson-Guptill
   Publication Date: 2001
   Edition: 2nd
   Number of Volumes: 1

```

## Instructions:

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Download the project files to your local machine.
3. Compile and run the program using the appropriate C++ compiler command.

## Usage:

This project is a great resource for learning about object-oriented programming in C++, specifically the concept of function overriding. It demonstrates how to create a derived class that enhances the functionality of a base class.
