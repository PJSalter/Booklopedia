### Booklopedia: Unveiling Encyclopedia Edition

- Enhanced Book Information: Overriding Member Functions with Encyclopedia Class.

This project is a part of Lab 11.14 and written in C++, focused on the concept of overriding member functions. It involves creating a derived class called Encyclopedia, which overrides the PrintInfo() function of the base Book class. The overridden function prints additional information, including the edition and number of volumes of the book.
